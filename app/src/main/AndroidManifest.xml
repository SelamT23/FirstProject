<!--
    Whatever component we develop as a part of your application, we must declare
    all its components in this manifest.xml which resides at the root of our application
    project directory. This file works as an interface between the Android OS and our
    application, so if we do not declare our component in this file, then it will
    not be considered by the OS.

    Here <application>...</application> tags enclosed the components related to the application.
    Attribute android:icon will point to the application icon available under res/drawable-hdpi.
    The application uses the image named ic_launcher.png located in the drawable folders

    The <activity> tag is used to specify an activity and android:name attribute specifies the
    fully qualified class name of the Activity subclass and the android:label attributes specifies
    a string to use as the label for the activity. You can specify multiple activities using <activity> tags.

    The action for the intent filter is named android.intent.action.MAIN to indicate that this activity serves
    as the entry point for the application. The category for the intent-filter is named android.intent.category.LAUNCHER
    to indicate that the application can be launched from the device's launcher icon.
